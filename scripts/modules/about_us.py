    #### About Us
    
    At VigyanShaala, we believe everyone should have the opportunity to create a better world through science. 
    That's why our mission at VigyanShaala is to enable the innovators of tomorrow to achieve their dreams by bringing science, 
    technology, and learning to their doorstep today. We are determined to create equity in STEM education and opportunities 
    for the most marginalised across India. Through carefully developed ecosystems, we can eradicate inequalities and help 
    even the most marginalized-- those who must innovate to survive - to thrive in STEM careers.
    
    #### What is She for STEM
    Incubated and launched between lockdowns by Prof. Ashutosh Kumar Sharma, then Secretary, DST., Program She for STEM(Kalpana) 
    is an online mentoring-career coaching fellowship designed to successfully place every fellow on a high confidence STEM path. 
    With a strong emphasis on the elements of Individual Development Plan, Self-Efficacy strengthening and 
    Research Grade Experimental Projects, over the last two years we have continuously evolved the program structure with 
    active partnership of our mentees themselves. These experiences and skills equip our fellows for marching into a high confidence 
    trajectory towards scientific jobs or higher studies in STEM at leading global and national universities.

    #### Who is it for
    The program is open to all enthusiastic and aspiring Female Undergraduates and postgraduates in Science, Technology, Engineering 
    and Math (STEM). The three key pillars we look for in a She for STEM Fellow are ACT - Ambition, Commitment and Talent.

    The first cohort of 'She for STEM' was launched by Honorable Governor of Uttarakhand (Retd.) Lt. General Gurmit Singh on 10th August 2024.
